<li><div class="para">With many parts of large cities racially segregated, data scientists have found that using zip codes as a variable is essentially the same as using race as a variable. So if a data scientists did not want to include race they may also not include zip code. What are some of the questions the model uses (variables)? Are these introducing variables that should be avoided when thinking about a fair and just society? What are some of these variables?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Other types of models instead look at common locations of crimes and send police to patrol those areas. Naturally, police find crime there and report it back to the algorithm. These areas tend to be the poorer neighborhoods in cities. What are some issues with this type of feedback to the algorithm? Does this algorithm seem fair?</div></li>

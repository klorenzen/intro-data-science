<div class="para">For this reason, we introduce Robust PCA. Our idea is that by taking many subsamples of our data, we expect not to be heavily impacted by what we expect to be only a few outliers. The question that must be answered now is how do we determine which subset to use as our ``typical'' data. Our intuition for outliers in PCA is that they would be far away from most of the data in the reduced space provided by PCA. One way to think about the size of the space that PCA finds is through the determinant. A small determinant would correspond to a compact space in which the data lies. With this intuition, we may hazard to guess that a good set to run PCA on would provide compact space. Our goal is to sample from our data set to find a minimum determinant of the covariance matrix.</div>

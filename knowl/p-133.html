<div class="para">If our question is <em class="emphasis">Which location in La Jolla has the highest rated burrito?</em> we can answer this using our data verbs. First, we would want to <dfn class="terminology">Filter</dfn> the neighborhood column so it only shows us places in La Jolla. Then we would want to <dfn class="terminology">Mutate</dfn> creating a new column which is the combination of the two ratings (either by summing them or finding the average). Finally we would <dfn class="terminology">Sort</dfn> by this combined rating column in descending order (leaving the biggest entry as the first one). Then the first row would give us our desired location!</div>

<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The local zoo has lots of animals that they house. Each animal is classified into a Kingdom, Genus, Family, and Species (as we remember from a biology class). These are based on certain characteristics which we have gathered data about. Some new animals have arrived and we want to classify them based on the data. Below you have the data for 10 known animals and three unknown animals.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Your first task is to use the data to group your known animals together. How do you know you have good groups?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now, look at the data of the unknown animals. Predict which groups they belong in.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Explain your method of putting the unknown animals into know groups? Which variables or combination of variables did you use?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Brainstorm ways that you could have done this task easier or better? How would computers help?</div></li>
</ol>
</div> <div class="para">Congratulations! You just did Data Science! You are a data scientist! Reviewing your first steps as a data scientist, what might be some other areas where a similar model is used?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-1-1.html#exploration-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para">Here we see that by using PCA we can nicely separate out at least one of the groups but there is a little overlap remaining. Part of the reason for this is that PCA relies heavily on the variance of each of the features. Since our features were not scaled down, we are not getting as clean an image as we may like. Whenever using PCA, we should always consider scaling our data before applying PCA!</div>

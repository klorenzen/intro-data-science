<div class="para">The first step to doing Data Science is to have data. Data comes in many forms but for the purposes of this section, we will think of data as information stored on a computer. Data is collected about people, countries, natural environment, institutions, and many others. Therefore, most data comes when humans interact with systems that collect data. This could be when you open tiktok on your phone and every like and comment you make. This could be when you swipe your keycard to get into a building. The key insight is that the data collected is reflected of actions of people. We cannot collect data about someone's emotions when they swipe into a building- we can make predictions, we can ask them- but these are not objective pieces of data. -side note about the field of psychology and survey design, but most of the data we will be exploring in this class will deal with objective data-</div>

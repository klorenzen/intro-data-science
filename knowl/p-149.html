<div class="para">When we subsample, there are a few decisions that we must make. One of the most important decisions in such a process is the size of the subsets chosen. In PCA we still want a representative sample of the entire data, so we should not choose a small (under 50%) proportion of our data. On the other hand, if the sampled set is too large, we are likely to choose outliers. A general rule of thumb is to select about 75% of the entire data set for each sample. Note that one cost of a resampling method such as this is cost. Instead of running PCA once, we will be running it potentially hundreds or thousands of times. As such, data sets with more than a few features might be time consuming and will eventually be impractical to check.</div>

<li><div class="para">Suppose a person had watched some of these movies and given them ratings. We would like to predict if they would like another movie. Which variables would we want to use?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Describe how you would organize the data according to these variables?</div></li>

<li><div class="para">Now suppose we are a movie production company and we are trying to determine whether to make a particular movie where we already have the script and director whose has made lots of movies for us before. We would like to estimate how much gross revenue we will get so we can set an appropriate budget. Which variables from the data set should we use for our analysis? Should we restrict the values? (If so, which ones and by what restriction.)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Based on what you know about the economy and movie distribution, what are some things we should be cautious about when we get our final answer. In other words, how might some of our data be corrupting our prediction? Brainstorm ways we might be able to get a more accurate answer.</div></li>
